Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the fol- lowing triangle:

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.
let abc = "abc"; console.log(abc.length); // â†’ 3

//     for (let y = 1; y <= x; y++) {
//         process.stdout.write('#');

//     console.log();

/*
FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz " for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)
